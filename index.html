                <p>The stat priority for a Holy Paladin varies based on your spell selection 
                    or fight duration, your proximity to your healing targets, and your talents. 
                    We will give the general stat priority, then explain how each of these can 
                    change it for you. Having said that, our secondary stats are so close in 
                    value, and Intellect is so strong at current gear levels, that an item 
                    level upgrade will usually be worth equipping. You should use the 
                    information on this page to help you decide
                    if one similar item level piece of gear is superior to another.</p>
                <p>In general Haste is a good stat. However, the value of Haste is difficult to 
                    determine because it can change significantly even on the same boss encounter. 
                    It does so because of your Mana usage and spell selection. If you find yourself 
                    out of Mana before a fight is over you should check to see if you were 
                    casting too many expensive spells. If not, then you can likely improve the 
                    situation by removing some Haste. You should aim to strike a balance between 
                    having enough haste to respond quickly 
                    when others take damage, while also not going out of Mana on longer fights.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Healing as a Holy Paladin is, for the most part, all about using the correct 
                    spells for the specific circumstances in which you find yourself, 
                    particularly with regard to how many raid members are taking damage, 
                    how much damage 
                    they are taking, where they are located, and what spells you have available.</p>
                <p>Naturally, if the target is not taking enough damage to 
                    justify using all of the above on them, you should instead 
                    use the spells to heal other raid members as needed.
                    In case you are forced to move and Holy Shock 
                    is on cooldown, you can also make use of Light of the Martyr to heal your target if 
                    they are at risk of dying (as long as it does not put you at risk to do so).</p>
                <code>Holy Shock > Flash of Light > Light of the Martyr</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Priorize Infusion of Light procs</li>
                    <li>Use Holy Light if low on Mana</li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <p>Introduced in Patch 8.2, Essences are unique items that drop from various 
                    forms of content. They are activated through your Heart of Azeroth, and 
                    they buff your character 
                    in various ways, depending on the Essences that are currently active.</p>
                <p>As a general guideline, assuming you are not required to 
                    use a special purpose essence for a specific encounter, 
                    your essence choices should be as follows.</p>
                <code>Vision > Symbiotic Presence > The Well of Existence</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Greater Flask of Endless Fathoms</li>
                    <li>Weapon: Deadly Navigation</li>

            <article>
                <p>For Holy Paladins, all four Rings of Azerite traits can have significant value, 
                    so you will want to prioritize using Azerite gear with more traits unlocked 
                    over higher item level pieces with only one or two Rings unlocked, unless 
                    the traits on the outer Rings
                    are both S+ level traits and the Middle or Inner Ring traits are much weaker.</p>
                <p>As a general rule, you should value each unlocked Azerite trait on an item 
                    as being worth at least 15 item levels. Please keep in mind that the actual 
                    difference will fluctuate when comparing items, depending on which traits 
                    are available. For a more precise comparison, there is 
                    an Azerite comparison tool on QE live that can directly compare two items.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Make no mistake, Holy Paladin's playstyle in dungeons is very different 
                    from raid. As you push higher keys, you'll realize that chesting a key 
                    is almost never decided by healing throughput. What sets Holy Paladin apart 
                    from other healers is our very high ceiling for damage output. Walking the 
                    line between dps and healer is where we thrive: the more damage we deal, 
                    the more reason there is to bring us over a Resto Druid. 
                    In this section I'll be breaking down everything 
                    you can do to keep your group safe while pushing your damage to it's limits.</p>
                <p>Also... Be excellent.</p>

                    <li>Be good</li>
